# JS Solo Mini-Project Guidelines

Welcome! You're looking at a relatively empty app, it's your canvas on which to create! We're going to make a Business Card Database!

We have a `db.json` with data for you. If you run `json-server`, the endpoints at `http://localhost:3000/humans` will give you the functionality you seek. The Human model has a `name`, `email`, `company`, and `catchphrase`. Use this information to allow your user full CRUD on your app.

Go to town with it! This is an opportunity for you to get creative.
